# journey
I want to be more accountable towards my learning, so I'm making it public!


# Current learning goals:

|Name|Due Date|Reason|
|---|---|---|
|[Discrete Math in Open University](https://www.openu.ac.il/courses/20476.htm)|June 2019|Working on my high level math skills, start with the basics. Learn what a university course means. |
|(Basic Statistics w/ R, by the University of Amsterdam)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics?specialization=social-science]|Done 60%, Will finish after Discrete|Statistics basics, helps in various skills.|

# Considering:
- Linear Algebra (Helps with: vectors, matrices - in use in many cs related subjects)
  - https://www.udemy.com/linear-algebra-theory-and-implementation/
  - https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning
  - https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-foundations-to-frontiers-0
  
- Calculus (Helps with: Differential equations[numerical analysis,], FFT, helps in probability and statistics, ML...)
- Numerical Methods?
- Algorithms: 
  - https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2
  - https://www.edx.org/micromasters/ucsandiegox-algorithms-and-data-structures
- Math for machine learning https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning

# Done already
- 2012 - HEMDA, ANN, Genetic Algorithms, Linear Regression
  - Our project: http://www.hemda.org.il/template/default.aspx?maincat=21&catId=129&pageId=1233 (אגם)
  
  Try to use EDX/Coursera as they are more honored.
